    <img src="pictures_and_videos/Nightmare_king_grimm/Fire_bats.png" />
    <p>in this attack Nightmare king grimm shoots 4 bats in this attack you will do the 2 most dmg I recommend small jumping when the first bat is above you and dashing towards grimm</p>
    <p>and doing the most dmg u can but if u get close to Nightmare king grimm too fast he will teleport away and recast the remaining bats or start the next attack</p>
       <br>

    <img src="pictures_and_videos/Nightmare_king_grimm/Cloak%20Spikes.jpg" />
    <p>in this attack grimm spread spikes in the floor and after a second they grow and do dmg I recommend in this attack get to a place with no spikes  </p>
    <p>and heal <bold>once</bold> if u heal more then once there is a high chance you will get hit by nightmare king grimm next attack</p>
      <br>
    <h3>Dash uppercut</h3>
    
    <p>in this attack Grimm teleport near you he slashes towards you and jump up towards you jumps up and spawns 5 big fireballs </p>
    <p>I recommend dodging by jumping and then dashing away while he is slashing to dodge after that go to the place he jumped from so you won't get hit by the fireballs</p>
       <br>
    <h3>Uppercut</h3>
    
    <p>in this attack nightmare king grimm teleport to the sky and then he jump to the location you were at when he teleported and slash towards you leaving a path of fire behind</p>

       <br>
    <h3>stun phase</h3>
    <img src="pictures_and_videos/Grimm/grimstun.png" />
    <p>this is not actually a attack grimm become a small bat for a short time and <bold>doesn't dmg you at all</bold> I recommend healing once or twice</p>
       <br>
    <h3>fire pillars</h3>
     <img src="pictures_and_videos/Nightmare_king_grimm/Fire_pillar.png" />
    <p>in this phase nightmare king grimm spawns 4 fire pillars each spawning to the location you been at 1second before i recomend dodging until 4 pillar start spawning</p>
    <p> then doing the most damage to nightmare king grim this is the attack that u can do the most damage to him</p>
