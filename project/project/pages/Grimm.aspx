    <br>

<h3>Pufferfish attack</h3>
<br>
<img src="pictures_and_videos/Grimm/pufferfish_attack.jpg" />
<p>in the pufferfish attack grim stays in the middle and sends fireballs everyone the best way to dodge all the fireballs is to stay near corner</p>
<p> and wait untill u must to jump the puffer fish attack isn't long</p>

<h3>Fire bats</h3>
<br>
<img src="pictures_and_videos/Grimm/fire_bats_grimm.png" />
<p>in this attack grimm shoots 3 bats in this attack you will do the most dmg I recommend jumping when the first bat is near u and dashing towards grimm</p>
<p>and then do the most dmg u can if u get close to Grimm too fast he will teleport away and recast the remaining bats or start the next attack</p>

<h3>Cloak Spikes</h3>
<br>
<img src="pictures_and_videos/Nightmare_king_grimm/Cloak%20Spikes.jpg" />
<p>in this attack grimm spread spikes in the floor and after a second they grow and do dmg I recommend in this attack get to a place with no spikes  </p>
<p>and heal <bold>once</bold> if u heal more then once there is a high chance you will get hit by grimm next attack</p>

<h3>Hit and run</h3>
<br>
<img src="pictures_and_videos/Grimm/grim_dash.png" />
<p>in this attack Grimm teleport near you he slashes towards you and jump up towards you jumps up and spawns 5 big fireballs </p>
<p>I recommend dodging bye dashing into him while he is slashing to dodge or go back and after that go to the place he jumped from so you wont get hit by the 5 fireballs</p>

<h3>slash jump</h3>
<br>
<p>in this attack Grimm teleport to the sky and then he jump to the location you were at when he teleported and slash towards you</p>
<p> I recomend to go to the other dirrection from Grimm so he misses you and then jump to dodge the slash</p>

<h3>grimm stunned</h3>
<br>
<img src="pictures_and_videos/grimstun.png" />
<p>this is not actually a attack grimm become a small bat for a short time and <bold>doesn't dmg you at all</bold> I recommend healing once or twice</p>
